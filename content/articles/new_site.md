The technical bits of this new site are rather interesting. It is generated by
[nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/). The [susy
plugin](http://susy.oddbird.net/) for [compass](http://www.compass-style.org/)
is the basis for the styling: the grid layout and the vertical rhythm of the
pages.


## nanoc

nanoc is a static site generator; one of many, in fact. I chose it mainly
because of its flexibility. That flexibility, though, can be a bit of a
hurdle when you first start using it.

Since there is no pre-defined structure for your nanoc site, it can be
daunting to figure out where to start on a new project. If you're interested,
my site's source is available on
[Github](http://github.com/dgoodlad/david.goodlad.ca). The interesting files
are:

* _Rules_: note the inclusion of compass and the susy plugin here, as well as
  the handling of asset files that don't need to be processed in any way.
* _content/index.html_: nanoc provides some pre-built helper modules, one of
  which, *Blogging*, gives access to a *sorted\_articles* method. It's used
  here to list exerpts from the three most recent articles.
* _content/articles/*_ there are a pair of files here for each article. In the
  yaml metadata file, note the kind and created\_at fields which are treated
  specially by the *Blogging* helpers.
