title: "Arch Linux on a Macbook Air 4,2"
exerpt: |
  Installing linux on a laptop, especially an Apple laptop, can be a
  frustrating experience. While the initial setup still isn't trivial,
  a pure EFI-boot copy of Arch Linux is by far the most straightforward install
  I've done. No mucking around with BIOS/MBR, experimental Xorg drivers,
  unstable binary-blob Wifi drivers, or complex suspend/resume scripts is
  required!
