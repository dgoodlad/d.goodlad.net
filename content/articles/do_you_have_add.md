No, I don’t mean Attention Deficit Disorder.

In a late-night discussion after RailsConf Europe, the term ‘ADD’ was thrown
around as an acronym for Ajax-Driven Development. The reason the acronym is so
good is that it’s associated with a disorder that causes problems. In other
words, driving your development with the need to provide AJAX functionality is
just plain crazy talk.

There are some developers (and more often, in my experience, PHBs) who choose to
design from the standpoint of “our site has to use AJAX”. When you’re building a
web app, yes, you’ll probably find some use for AJAX. But don’t use it as the
base for all of your ideas! This is a classic example of having a solution and
looking for a problem.

AJAX is here to expand the possible usability of our applications, it is not a
methodology.
